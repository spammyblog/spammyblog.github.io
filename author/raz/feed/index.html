				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year we covered a <a href="https://spammy.blog/penny-stocks/">flavour of spam which tried to convince the reader to buy out penny stocks</a> promising huge gains within the coming weeks. Starting with the beginning of April, there was another huge wave of spam sent out in an attempt to get people to buy into a different stock.</p>
<p>As with the previous penny stocks emails, the people behind the spam buy massive amounts of shares of a poorly known company for dirt cheap. Then, when they&#8217;ve acquired a whole bunch of shares, they send out the spam in an attempt to get people to buy their shares at an artificially inflated price.</p>
<p>Included below are all of the various spam email templates which were sent out:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Subject: I have a tip I want to share with you</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In less than 2 days, this stock will go up 20 times overnight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve done a lot for you over the years and you&#8217;ve made an insane amount of profits listening to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today and tomorrow is your last chance to seize the opportunity before it disappears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My good friend who works at a firm I will not mention in upstate NY told me that a big takeover is about to happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A little American biopharma company discovered a new treatment for cancerous tumors and one of the biggest companies (starts with a P) is going to announce the official takeover on Wednesday (in 2 days).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The price at which this will happen more than 20 times what their stock is trading at now. Literally at 23 bucks a share from a current 80 cents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Write this symbol down, it&#8217;s the first letter of each word: Quest Science Management Gate that&#8217;s q followed by s then m and g</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the 4 letter symbol you need to tell your broker you want to buy, or just type it in yourself in your brokerage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope you&#8217;re ready to make it big. I expect a big thank you and an invite for steak this weekend.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Subject: By tomorrow evening this stock will be twenty times higher</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you read my urgent email yesterday?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I outlined very specifically a game plan for you to make more than 20 times on your principle within the next 48 hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me hit you with the gravy and leave out all the boring details… there&#8217;s a friend of mine who works at a top 50 firm upstate and he was privy to details of a take over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a nutshell there is a very large pharmaceutical company (its name starts with a P) who is finalizing the acquisition of a small public corporation that is currently trading at around 80 cents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The take over price will be a little over 20 bucks and the official announcement is coming tomorrow night (wed night).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They&#8217;re paying this much for it because of a novel stem cell treatment which eradicates cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t need to tell you what will happen to the share price when this announcement hits the news outlets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s trading symbol is Q as in Quest, S as in Sam, M as in Mother, G as in Great.</p>
<p>These are the 4 letters you need to type into your brokerage account to buy the stock or give to your broker over the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just ten thousand bucks into this will turn into over two hundred grand by Thursday morning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to act quickly though because it seems I may not be the only one with this information, as I am seeing the price creep up a little already since Monday.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Subject: This company&#8217;s being acquired tomorrow</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its share price is going through the stratosphere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cat might be out of the bag now but there is still a massive opportunity to benefit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I say that the secret is out because the stock price has gone up two days in a row but the reality is that it must be very few people who know information otherwise it would&#8217;ve gone ten times higher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case you missed my message yesterday, here is what is happening.. A big pharma corp is acquiring a minuscule public co and this is happening at a price that is 20 times greater than where it currently is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that if you can put 10 thousand in right now, you will take out 200 grand by Thursday morning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This info is solid. It comes from an attorney who&#8217;s a long time friend of mine and who literally saw the acquisition documents with his own eyes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must be wondering what the company&#8217;s trading symbol is, and I will not tease you any longer… it&#8217;s Q like in Quality, S like in Straight, M like Mary and G like Gold</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These four letters together make up the company&#8217;s ticker and that&#8217;s what you will need to give to your broker, or type into your online account to purchase the stock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I highly recommend you do this as quickly as possible because there is no guarantee that the price will remain this low much longer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I expect it&#8217;ll continue to rise and rise as the insider information spreads. Nonetheless the potential to benefit is absolutely gigantic here.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Subject: This time sensitive information could make you very wealthy</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you missed my heads up over this last week and a half, this is finally your time to act because in just 48 hours something big is going to happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is probably the last time that I will contact you  with this information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My friend at goldman gave me a call over the weekend and told me that the big acquisition we’ve been waiting for is going to occur on Wednesday. The day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pfizer is going to complete the purchase of QSMG (a small, public company) at a price of 23.79 dollars a share. For those of you doing the math out there, that&#8217;s approximately 30 times higher than where the stock is at now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re wondering why it&#8217;s happening at such a high price, that’s because these guys just completed human trials on a cancer drug which has proved to be effective in around 40% of cases, and big pharma wants this for itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect that I am not the only one who might have heard of this news so the stock may start climbing today and tomorrow before the big announcement becomes public on Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is quite literally the chance of a lifetime. If you miss out, you&#8217;ll probably never be able to make 30x on your money so fast again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ten grand into QSMG today will turn into a quarter million bucks by Thursday.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Subject: This stock tip is for your eyes only. The chance may never come again</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know of a cutting edge company that has just completed the development of a new life saving medicine. A friend who works at a high position, at a secretive place told me about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This medicine has been proven in both lab tests, and human tests to destroy tumors in almost 50% of of instances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For all practical purposes, I would call it a cure for one of the most deadly diseases of our times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being the type of person that I am, I asked myself how we can profit from this information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answer is very simple. Within the next week or two, QSMG will make the announcement public and once they do, their stock will go up to over 20 bucks overnight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the trick is to grab shares right now, while their price is still dirt cheap and while nobody knows what&#8217;s about to come.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is how you get your big break. This is how your life will finally change. Take the leap forward.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Subject: Do not miss on this chance to triple your money in the market</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a rare opportunity in the market right now, so rare that it may only happen once in a lifetime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have it on good information that a small biotech company is about to receive approval from the f d a for a life-saving medicine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This medicine is poised to become the next biggest seller in the world as it has just been shown to kill cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why there has been a lot of activity surrounding the stock. People are trading it on wrong information, and it&#8217;s in the red today because of that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I highly suggest that you buy in right now while fools are getting out, and the stock is cheap because it&#8217;s going to go up twenty fold in the next 2 weeks when the public announcement comes out, and the medicine is officially approved. Move quickly though, because otherwise you will miss out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The opportunity to buy QSMG at these discounts will not last long, and you will regret you didn&#8217;t jump in when you had the chance.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Subject: Here is a tip that could change your life</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a good friend who works at the fda, and from time to time he tells me about things before they happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why I am sending you this message today. Earlier this week he told me about a company that has found a way to kill cancer tumors in 40% of all breast and prostate cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this isn&#8217;t a one hundred percent method, it works good enough to save over 50 million lives a year.<br />
The company just completed human trials a couple of weeks ago and have yet to release the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once those positive results hit the public, the company&#8217;s shares are going to go nuts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>QSMG is currently at under 3 bucks a share. I can guarantee that it will pass 25 to 30 before the end of the month when those results are out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Act quickly by getting in now and securing yourself a position ahead of the herd.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Subject: An imminent event is sending this stock price through the roof.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What if I told you that I know of a company that has actually found a cure for cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They have proven its efficacy in animal tests and have recently just completed their testing on humans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results of the tests on the human subjects are not out yet, we are expecting them to become public some time in the next two to three weeks, but a friend of mine who works at the FDA told me that they are life changing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that in around forty percent of cases, tumors were successfully destroyed. This number is absolutely huge!<br />
It means that more than a third of the people with cancer can be cured with this therapy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is going to change the world, and once the announcement becomes public,<br />
it is guaranteed that their stock price will go to more than 24 to 30 bucks in a matter of hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why I highly, highly recommend that you buy QSMG as soon as you can today. Get in ahead of the herd.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Subject: This company found a cure for cancer. Their stock is flying.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a super rare opportunity that may never come again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This biotech company has finally found a cure for cancer after more than 20 years of stem cells and immunotherapy research.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They had very positive trials both on animals and humans (according to my sources) where tumors got killed at a rate of 41%</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their medicine is going to change the world once it gets rolled out in a few months. We are awaiting an official announcement form the company in the next couple of weeks, but it seems I am not the only one in the know because their stock has quadrupled since last week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>QSMG is guaranteed to hit 25 bucks a share overnight once they release their announcement to the public. You really need to think about buying shares right now before it shoots up higher.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Subject: An imminent green light from the fda will send this drug maker soaring.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are very few times in life when we truly get the chance to be part of something big, and profitable at the same time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The doctors at QSMG have been working nonstop for more than 20 years to get to this moment a cure for cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They completed animal trials last year which were very positive, and completed human trials just a few days ago with the fda&#8217;s blessing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results are not out yet but according to my sources, the human trials were very successful as well and cancer cells were successfully killed in 40% of all cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>40% might not seem like a passing grade, but it is above and beyond what everyone was expecting. This makes it the most successful cancer drug on earth, and best of all it is non-invasive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results will be announced this month, and once they are out the stock will jump to $25 a share overnight and will continue up to $50 or more quickly after.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Want to feel like a genius? Buy QSMG right now while it&#8217;s still at just 2 dollars, and wait it out 2 weeks. You will be rewarded handsomely.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The general theme of the emails is that there is some company which is rumoured to have found a cure for cancer. Some emails claim the company will be acquired by a large pharmaceutical company, other emails don&#8217;t. All the emails claim that the share price for this company in particular is going to skyrocket to 20-30x within a few days, and they are trying to create a sense of urgency for the reader to buy in ASAP.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection of the stock they&#8217;re boasting, here is the price history as reported by Google:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last flavour of spam which we looked at <a href="https://spammy.blog/get-rich-quick/">get rich quick scams</a> (which are in full swing right now). During my investigation of a few of them to understand how they operate, I went through the process of trying to load my account on their website up with money using my virtual credit card. My virtual credit card has $0 balance so whenever anyone tries to charge it I get an email that looks something like this:</p>
<figure id="attachment_240" style="width: 318px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-240" src="https://spammy.blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-27-at-12.06.35-AM.png" alt="Virtual Credit Card Transaction Denied" width="318" height="482" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-27-at-12.06.35-AM.png 644w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-27-at-12.06.35-AM-198x300.png 198w" sizes="(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Virtual Credit Card Transaction Denied</figcaption></figure>
<p>I was mostly interested in figuring out what the end goal of these get rich quick scam websites is. Do they actually try to charge credit cards and take the money and run? Or do they just harvest credit card credentials and sell them in bulk on black markets.</p>
<p>It turns out that the answer is mixed. Some of these websites will try to charge you right away, and some do not. I suppose it depends on who is behind the instance of the scam.</p>
<p>However, where things got interesting is when I got a call on my cellphone moments after one of my transactions failed, and the person on the other end queried for someone by the name of the fake alias which I use.</p>
<p>I was taken aback at first so I told the person I was at the gym and that they should call me back in a few minutes.</p>
<p>They called me back and I recorded it:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/304745160%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-4jp8e&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true" width="100%" height="300" frameborder="no" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>The person on the other end clearly had a lot of experience in the business as he comfortably held conversation with me regarding his scam.</p>
<p>He spent some time explaining that the service he offers is really simple to use, and that I will get a dedicated mentor to guide me and invest my money. He made it clear that there would be very little work to do on my part, the money would just rise on its own.</p>
<p>Upon asking for clarification of what their &#8220;experts&#8221; do with my money, he dodged the question and reassured me that I don&#8217;t need to worry, they&#8217;ll handle the details.</p>
<p>After that he insisted I go and fund my account using my credit card. I made up a fake bank name when he asked me about it, and he immediately said that bank is known to have issues.</p>
<p>After entering my virtual credit card details into their system, the payment failed and he said he expected that since the bank I mentioned was problematic for them.</p>
<p>At that point, he told me to go to <a href="http://entropay.com">entropay.com</a> and create a virtual credit card with them, fund my card with $250 and then send him a screenshot of the virtual card via email.</p>
<p>The call ended after he gave me those instructions, and I went ahead and forged an entropay virtual credit card screenshot, emailed it to him, and never heard from him again.</p>
<p>If you get a call similar to the one I received, hang up immediately because it&#8217;s a scam.</p>
<p>Until next time,</p>
<p>Stay safe.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Today&#8217;s flavour: get rich quick schemes</h2>
<p>This week has been a fruitful one when it comes to reporting on new types of spam emerging. Today we take a closer look at spam which promises to give you the ability to get rich quick, and with little to no effort.</p>
<h2>The process</h2>
<p>The email spam itself comes in many different shapes and sizes, there is no real pattern to it. When you click on the link in the email, you will be presented with a web page which looks something like this:</p>
<figure id="attachment_193" style="width: 853px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-193" src="https://spammy.blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screencapture-awesome-revenue-lp-zulander-hack-lp-zulander-hack-step-2-1483489710604-1-e1483504613304.png" alt="" width="853" height="3484" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Zulander Scam Landing Page</figcaption></figure>
<p>Right off the bat we can tell that the web page is not as professionally designed as some of the other ones which we&#8217;ve taken a look at on this blog. This may be indicative of different people being behind the different types of spam which we&#8217;re seeing.</p>
<h3>Anatomy of the landing page</h3>
<p>Starting from the top, the banner has your country&#8217;s flag on it in an effort to make it a more personalized feeling, as if you&#8217;ve been specially selected. Then, the real centrepiece of the landing page is the video which starts playing automatically. It features a man dressed in a suit and tie and driving around in a Ferrari, clearly meant to make an impression on the viewer. The man further emphasizes the personalized aspect of the whole thing by claiming that this webpage has been generated specifically for you in Canada, and that you cannot share it with anybody else.</p>
<p>The man in the video goes on to talk about how he owns a company and has several programmers working for him who came up with some software over the course of a year which automagically makes money and has something to do with stocks. The video leaves the details out intentionally.</p>
<p>The man goes on to show several fake bank balances of large sums of money in an effort to prove that the method he has invented really does work. After this, he sets up a scene with (clearly) paid actors to &#8220;try his method or he&#8217;ll give them $1000 cash upfront&#8221;.</p>
<p>The video goes on for another 30 minutes insisting that his method works and that the viewer must sign up quickly before there are no spots left. This ties together with the counters along the edges of the website which continue to update the &#8220;remaining free licenses&#8221; left as they go down.</p>
<p>An overarching theme of all of these scam webpages seems to be to create a sense of urgency in their victims.</p>
<h2>Signing up</h2>
<p>So, after watching the <em>short</em> half an hour video and being left convinced that this is your key to being rich and famous, you decide to sign up using the form provided. What happens after that?</p>

<p>You are sent to a different website with a video of the same man playing. This time, the man tells you that you have only 7 minutes to deposit some money into your account because other people are quickly taking up the free licenses. Yet again the creation of a sense of urgency. Don&#8217;t think, just do.</p>
<p>Upon dismissing the video and proceeding to fund your account, you are presented with a dashboard to enter your credit card details, or alternatively pay with bitcoin.</p>

<p>Of course we had to see what happens when someone would go ahead and enter their credit card details into the form. With our handy no-balance virtual credit card provided by <a href="https://cash.me/">Squash Cash</a>, we went ahead and filled out the form. However, unlike other scam sites before it, it didn&#8217;t even try to charge our credit card and instead simply showed an error message.</p>
<figure id="attachment_202" style="width: 1042px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-202" src="https://spammy.blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-03-at-7.33.39-PM.png" alt="BinaryUno Error Message" width="1042" height="616" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-03-at-7.33.39-PM.png 1042w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-03-at-7.33.39-PM-300x177.png 300w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-03-at-7.33.39-PM-768x454.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-03-at-7.33.39-PM-1024x605.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1042px) 100vw, 1042px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">BinaryUno Error Message</figcaption></figure>
<p>We tried several times and the credit card details were definitely correct, so we decided to move on and explore the rest of their website.</p>
<h2>The scammer&#8217;s website</h2>
<p>Along the top we can see a menu which consists of several tabs:</p>
<ol>
<li>My Account</li>
<li>Trade Now</li>
<li>Deposit</li>
<li>Education</li>
<li>Trading Tools</li>
<li>Help</li>
<li>About Us</li>
<li>Contact Us</li>
</ol>
<p>Starting from the left:</p>
<h3>My account</h3>
<figure id="attachment_204" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-204" src="https://spammy.blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screencapture-binaryuno-account-1483506319051.png" alt="Zulander Scam Account Tab" width="2560" height="2622" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screencapture-binaryuno-account-1483506319051.png 2560w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screencapture-binaryuno-account-1483506319051-293x300.png 293w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screencapture-binaryuno-account-1483506319051-768x787.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screencapture-binaryuno-account-1483506319051-1000x1024.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Zulander Scam Account Tab</figcaption></figure>
<p>This tab contains your basic info, along with the ability to change your password. On the far right however is a section where you can upload documents. It seems as though there are several required documents in order to use their website:</p>
<figure id="attachment_205" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-205" src="https://spammy.blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screencapture-binaryuno-compliance-identification-documents-upload-1483490105025.png" alt="BinaryUno Required Documents" width="2560" height="2116" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screencapture-binaryuno-compliance-identification-documents-upload-1483490105025.png 2560w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screencapture-binaryuno-compliance-identification-documents-upload-1483490105025-300x248.png 300w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screencapture-binaryuno-compliance-identification-documents-upload-1483490105025-768x635.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screencapture-binaryuno-compliance-identification-documents-upload-1483490105025-1024x846.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">BinaryUno Required Documents</figcaption></figure>
<p>They require a copy of your passport or drivers license, proof of address such as a recent utility bill, and a copy of your credit card or banking info. Sounds pretty reasonable to me.</p>
<p>One interesting thing to note about the withdrawal section is that they claim to charge a $35 fee per withdrawal. In the off chance that they aren&#8217;t just running away with everyone&#8217;s money, this could be how they make money from people who join and quickly regret it and want to take their money back.</p>

<p>The Trade Now tab is likely meant to be the place to go when you actually want to start trading some stocks and making some money. In the middle you have an interface which appears to promise the ability to buy currency at a certain price and sell it at another price. Along the right you have a leaderboard of sorts with the top dollar amounts earned by various (likely fake) users.</p>
<h3>Deposit</h3>
<p>This is the page we were placed on when we first got sent to the website and told to quickly deposit some money.</p>
<h3>Education</h3>

<figure id="attachment_214" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-214" src="https://spammy.blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screencapture-binaryuno-trading-1483508602018.png" alt="BinaryDuo Scam Site Leaderboards" width="2560" height="4548" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screencapture-binaryuno-trading-1483508602018.png 2560w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screencapture-binaryuno-trading-1483508602018-169x300.png 169w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screencapture-binaryuno-trading-1483508602018-768x1364.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screencapture-binaryuno-trading-1483508602018-576x1024.png 576w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">BinaryDuo Scam Site Leaderboards</figcaption></figure>
<p>This interface appears to give the user the ability to simply copy the trades which the top dogs are doing, in an effort to earn a profit for themselves. The sole purpose of this leaderboard is to attempt to assure the viewer that there are in fact other people who are using this service and making money, further putting them at ease.</p>
<h2>Extras</h2>
<p>Upon signing up, I received an email at the address which I registered with:</p>
<figure id="attachment_217" style="width: 1612px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-217" src="https://spammy.blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-04-at-12.59.35-AM.png" alt="BinaryUno Automatic Email" width="1612" height="800" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-04-at-12.59.35-AM.png 1612w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-04-at-12.59.35-AM-300x149.png 300w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-04-at-12.59.35-AM-768x381.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-04-at-12.59.35-AM-1024x508.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1612px) 100vw, 1612px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">BinaryUno Automatic Email</figcaption></figure>
<p>It looked reasonably professional, and so I decided to go along with it and see what happens if I replied.</p>
<figure id="attachment_218" style="width: 1602px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-218" src="https://spammy.blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-04-at-12.59.40-AM.png" alt="BinaryUno Email Convo" width="1602" height="424" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-04-at-12.59.40-AM.png 1602w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-04-at-12.59.40-AM-300x79.png 300w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-04-at-12.59.40-AM-768x203.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-04-at-12.59.40-AM-1024x271.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1602px) 100vw, 1602px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">BinaryUno Email Convo</figcaption></figure>
<p>I replied back saying that there was an error processing my credit card details and if they could process it manually.</p>
<p>They replied back within a minute gladly obliging to processing my credit card for me.</p>
<figure id="attachment_219" style="width: 1610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-219" src="https://spammy.blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-04-at-12.59.49-AM.png" alt="BinaryUno Email Convo" width="1610" height="442" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-04-at-12.59.49-AM.png 1610w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-04-at-12.59.49-AM-300x82.png 300w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-04-at-12.59.49-AM-768x211.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-04-at-12.59.49-AM-1024x281.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1610px) 100vw, 1610px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">BinaryUno Email Convo</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_220" style="width: 1588px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-220" src="https://spammy.blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-04-at-12.59.53-AM.png" alt="BinaryUno Email Convo" width="1588" height="462" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-04-at-12.59.53-AM.png 1588w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-04-at-12.59.53-AM-300x87.png 300w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-04-at-12.59.53-AM-768x223.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-04-at-12.59.53-AM-1024x298.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1588px) 100vw, 1588px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">BinaryUno Email Convo</figcaption></figure>
<p>To which I replied with my credit card details:</p>
<figure id="attachment_221" style="width: 1586px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-221" src="https://spammy.blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-04-at-12.59.58-AM.png" alt="BinaryUno Email Convo" width="1586" height="458" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-04-at-12.59.58-AM.png 1586w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-04-at-12.59.58-AM-300x87.png 300w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-04-at-12.59.58-AM-768x222.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-04-at-12.59.58-AM-1024x296.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1586px) 100vw, 1586px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">BinaryUno Email Convo</figcaption></figure>
<p>And I never heard from them again.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting however is that they didn&#8217;t even attempt to charge my card. It&#8217;s because of this that I believe the real purpose of this whole setup is to claim credit card numbers, and ultimately sell them on underground markets.</p>
<p>If they didn&#8217;t want to sell the credit card numbers which they collect, then they should have charged mine as soon as I handed over the details. But instead they chose to ignore me.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This was possibly the most involved scam which I have covered on this blog. The people behind this went to considerable effort to make the website look somewhat believable, even if the initial landing page with the video was leaning on the mediocre side.</p>
<p>This is not the first time I have seen this type of get rich quick spam being blasted out, however it is the first time I&#8217;ve seen the avenue for credit card collection done like this.</p>
<h2>Takeaways</h2>
<ol>
<li>If something seems too good to be true, it usually is. Don&#8217;t fall for random strangers telling you that they can help you get rich quick if you give them money first.</li>
<li>Be a good friend, and be sure to break the bad news if anybody enthusiastically sends you links to this sort of thing.</li>
<li>Always be very selective about who you give your credit card details to. Definitely do not follow in my footsteps which I leave behind on this blog because the credit card I use for my investigations is special and money cannot be taken from it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Until next time,</p>
<p>Stay safe.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Today&#8217;s flavour: surveys</h2>
<p>A new flavour of spam has emerged lately with the apparent promise of being rewarded for filling out quick surveys.</p>
<h2>The process</h2>
<p>The spam email which you will get may take on any number of formats, with the content not necessarily explicitly mentioning anything about surveys. The emails which I got simply contained a link with the title &#8220;Hi &lt;name&gt;&#8221; in the body, and a subject line saying &#8220;&lt;name&gt; in for a big surprise! &#8211; Don&#8217;t miss&#8221;.</p>
<figure style="width: 625px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://cdn.spammy.blog/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-02-at-9.14.44-PM.png" alt="Sample Email" width="625" height="317" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Sample Email</figcaption></figure>
<p>Upon clicking the link, there are several layers of redirection before finally landing at the survey page. The survey page itself will also take on different shapes and sizes, however the theme stays the same: you are presented with a survey to complete and the promise of a prize at the end.</p>
<figure style="width: 655px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-123" src="https://cdn.spammy.blog/2017/01/screencapture-customersurveys-stream-1483409935684-282x300.png" alt="Survey Spam Website" width="655" height="697" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screencapture-customersurveys-stream-1483409935684-282x300.png 282w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screencapture-customersurveys-stream-1483409935684-768x817.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screencapture-customersurveys-stream-1483409935684-962x1024.png 962w" sizes="(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Survey Spam Website</figcaption></figure>
<p>One thing to note right off the bat is that these websites also appear to have a fake comments section at the bottom, something we have seen before with <a href="https://spammy.blog/miracle-pills/">the miracle pill scam pages</a>. The intention is likely the same; to generate a sense of confidence that the web page is legitimate. If other people are saying good things about it, then it must really be good.</p>
<p>The survey questions themselves differ based on the web page you happen to land on, but in the case of the fake Amazon survey, the questions were as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>How do you normally access Amazon?</li>
<li>How often do you visit Amazon?</li>
<li>How would you rate your satisfaction with the Amazon website?</li>
<li>Do you follow Amazon on social media?</li>
</ol>
<p>At which point it tells you that it is submitting your answers, then checking offer inventory, and finally it displays the promised prizes which are available for you.</p>
<figure id="attachment_127" style="width: 629px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-127" src="https://cdn.spammy.blog/2017/01/screencapture-customersurveys-stream-1483410521090-179x300.png" alt="Survey Scam Prizes" width="629" height="1054" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screencapture-customersurveys-stream-1483410521090-179x300.png 179w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screencapture-customersurveys-stream-1483410521090-768x1286.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screencapture-customersurveys-stream-1483410521090-611x1024.png 611w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Survey Scam Prizes</figcaption></figure>
<p>The prizes differ from survey to survey, but in my instance I had anti-aging cream, male enhancement pills, muscle enhancement pills, wrinkle reduction cream, and one which was &#8220;out of stock&#8221;: a macbook pro.</p>
<p>I noticed that there is a comment textbox where you can post your own comment, and upon trying to do so you will simply get a popup which says your comment is &#8220;currently awaiting approval&#8221;.</p>
<figure id="attachment_128" style="width: 458px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-128" src="https://cdn.spammy.blog/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-02-at-9.34.19-PM-300x112.png" alt="Survey Spam Waiting For Approval" width="458" height="171" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-02-at-9.34.19-PM-300x112.png 300w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-02-at-9.34.19-PM-768x286.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-02-at-9.34.19-PM.png 844w" sizes="(max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Survey Spam Waiting For Approval</figcaption></figure>
<h3>The prizes</h3>
<p>So, what happens when you select a prize? Here are pictures of the webpages I was presented with:</p>
<h4>Anti-aging cream</h4>
<figure id="attachment_130" style="width: 474px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-130 " src="https://cdn.spammy.blog/2017/01/screencapture-retinolla-promo-kit-1483410738457.png" alt="Anti-Aging Prize" width="474" height="2098" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screencapture-retinolla-promo-kit-1483410738457.png 2560w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screencapture-retinolla-promo-kit-1483410738457-68x300.png 68w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screencapture-retinolla-promo-kit-1483410738457-768x3399.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Anti-Aging Prize</figcaption></figure>
<h4>Male enhancement pill</h4>
<p>This one&#8217;s not safe for work. <a href="https://cdn.spammy.blog/2017/01/screencapture-buynutragentex-ca-promotion-desktop-index-php-1483410765119.png">Click here to see the website screenshot</a>.</p>
<h4>Muscle enhancement pill</h4>
<figure id="attachment_132" style="width: 478px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-132" src="https://cdn.spammy.blog/2017/01/screencapture-hypertoneforce-ca-v6-1334-1483410800832.png" alt="Muscle Enhancement Prize" width="478" height="1469" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screencapture-hypertoneforce-ca-v6-1334-1483410800832.png 2560w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screencapture-hypertoneforce-ca-v6-1334-1483410800832-98x300.png 98w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screencapture-hypertoneforce-ca-v6-1334-1483410800832-768x2360.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screencapture-hypertoneforce-ca-v6-1334-1483410800832-333x1024.png 333w" sizes="(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Muscle Enhancement Prize</figcaption></figure>
<h4>Anti-wrinkle cream</h4>
<figure id="attachment_133" style="width: 493px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-133" src="https://cdn.spammy.blog/2017/01/screencapture-tryrejuvaessence-oa-ca1-1483410820192.png" alt="Anti Wrinkle Prize" width="493" height="2060" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screencapture-tryrejuvaessence-oa-ca1-1483410820192.png 2560w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screencapture-tryrejuvaessence-oa-ca1-1483410820192-72x300.png 72w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screencapture-tryrejuvaessence-oa-ca1-1483410820192-768x3208.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screencapture-tryrejuvaessence-oa-ca1-1483410820192-245x1024.png 245w" sizes="(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Anti Wrinkle Prize</figcaption></figure>
<p>If any of these pages seem familiar, it&#8217;s because they are; they have the identical look and feel to the checkout pages from <a href="https://spammy.blog/miracle-pills/">the miracle pill scam</a>. The pages are carefully crafted to look convincing and professional. In addition, they create a sense of urgency by displaying a notice at the top which indicates to the reader that the supply of the item is running low, and that they should order as soon as possible.</p>
<p>But wait, all of these pages are asking where to send the <em>trial</em> to. They aren&#8217;t asking you to buy anything, so what&#8217;s the big deal?</p>
<h3>The end goal</h3>

<p>Upon filling out the form for claiming your free trial, we finally get to the part of the process where we find out how the scammer makes money from all of this:</p>
<figure id="attachment_147" style="width: 506px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-147" src="https://cdn.spammy.blog/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-02-at-10.06.19-PM.png" alt="Pay For Shipping" width="506" height="316" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-02-at-10.06.19-PM.png 2006w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-02-at-10.06.19-PM-300x187.png 300w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-02-at-10.06.19-PM-768x479.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-02-at-10.06.19-PM-1024x639.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Pay For Shipping</figcaption></figure>
<p>You have to enter your credit card details and pay for &#8220;<em>shipping and handling</em>&#8220;. I have a virtual credit card from <a href="https://cash.me/">Square Cash</a> which has no balance and which I like to use for things like this to see what actually happens when you enter your credit card. In this case, they genuinely try to charge $7.99 from the merchant &#8220;Azd*buildxtreme&#8221;.</p>
<figure id="attachment_148" style="width: 280px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-148" src="https://cdn.spammy.blog/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-02-at-10.13.27-PM.png" alt="Credit Card Transaction" width="280" height="429" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-02-at-10.13.27-PM.png 624w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-02-at-10.13.27-PM-196x300.png 196w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Credit Card Transaction</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty clear that the same people who are behind this spam were also behind the miracle pill spam which was sent out several weeks ago. The end goal is the same &#8211; to get you to give them your credit card info &#8211; but the method of obtaining it is slightly different.</p>
<p>The look and feel of the web pages used for the scam is quite convincing and high quality. It is not the traditional &#8220;slap anything together&#8221; type of web pages which normally accompany these sorts of things.</p>
<h2>Takeaways</h2>
<ol>
<li>As always, if something seems to good to be true, it usually is.</li>
<li>If your friends send you links to surveys like these, let them know it&#8217;s fake.</li>
<li>Be very selective of who you give your credit card details to.</li>
</ol>
<p>Until next time,</p>
<p>Stay safe.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>January 3rd update #1</strong></p>
<p>I am continuing to receive this spam disguised as various different email formats. Some about home mortgage, and some about winter socks. The surveys for these were related to Google Chrome as opposed to Amazon.</p>

<figure id="attachment_110" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-110" src="https://cdn.spammy.blog/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-28-at-2.03.13-AM-300x276.png" alt="Bank Loan Spam Form" width="590" height="543" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-28-at-2.03.13-AM-300x276.png 300w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-28-at-2.03.13-AM-768x707.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-28-at-2.03.13-AM-1024x942.png 1024w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-28-at-2.03.13-AM.png 1204w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Bank Loan Spam Form</figcaption></figure>
<p>Some time goes by, and then the spammer gets back to me with more details about my $10,000 loan which has been approved! Great news! The last thing I need to give them is my banking information so they can give me the loan in the form of a direct deposit.</p>
<figure id="attachment_111" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-111" src="https://cdn.spammy.blog/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-28-at-2.12.38-AM-300x190.png" alt="Bank Loan Spam Direct Deposit Form" width="710" height="450" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-28-at-2.12.38-AM-300x190.png 300w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-28-at-2.12.38-AM-768x488.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-28-at-2.12.38-AM-1024x650.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Bank Loan Spam Direct Deposit Form</figcaption></figure>
<p>Upon filling out some fake banking information, several minutes later they get back to me telling me that it&#8217;s illegal for them to give out loans without having some insurance policy first. The policy costs a small fee of $250, and to let them know if I&#8217;m okay with that.</p>
<figure id="attachment_112" style="width: 693px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-112" src="https://cdn.spammy.blog/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-28-at-2.15.37-AM-300x151.png" alt="Bank Loan Spam Insurance Policy" width="693" height="349" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-28-at-2.15.37-AM-300x151.png 300w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-28-at-2.15.37-AM-768x387.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-28-at-2.15.37-AM-1024x516.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Bank Loan Spam Insurance Policy</figcaption></figure>
<p>At this point we finally get to the part of the process where the spammer becomes a scammer. Upon receiving this email, it&#8217;s pretty clear what the next step will be: they want us to send them money before they send us money.</p>
<figure id="attachment_113" style="width: 659px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-113" src="https://cdn.spammy.blog/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-28-at-2.19.01-AM-300x135.png" alt="Bank Loan Scam MoneyGram" width="659" height="297" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-28-at-2.19.01-AM-300x135.png 300w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-28-at-2.19.01-AM-768x346.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-28-at-2.19.01-AM-1024x461.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 659px) 100vw, 659px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Bank Loan Scam MoneyGram</figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally they give me instructions to send them $250 via Money gram. This is where I had to stop, but we can take some pretty good guesses at what happens next.</p>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>This spam is sent out targeting people who are in need of a loan, and hopefully a little bit gullible. Upon baiting their victim in with promises of large loans with low interest rates and having them fill out multiple forms including their direct deposit information, they then get their victim to send them a (comparatively) small sum of money. Once the money is transferred to the scammers, they take that money and you never hear from them again. No loan for you.</p>
<h1>Some key take-aways:</h1>
<ol>
<li>Don&#8217;t trust random people claiming to want to give you money for free over email</li>
<li>When in doubt, consult with friends and family</li>
<li>As always, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is</li>
</ol>
<p>Until next time,</p>
<p>Stay safe.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The previous post I wrote was about the <a href="https://spammy.blog/2016/12/21/miracle-pills/">fake Miracle Pill spam</a> sent out which tried to sell potential victims pills with super powers. These websites do not tend to stay live for very long as they get taken down (probably by law enforcement). However, upon looking back at some of the URLs which were sent to me from that flavour of spam, I noticed something interesting. The websites where the fake articles were being hosted were always subdomains, and not root domains (ie. they would be hosted at subdomain.example.com as opposed to just example.com). At first glance I assumed that the people behind the scam owned the whole domain and just happened to host their fake article on various subdomains of their choosing. However, upon visiting the root domains of these fake article websites, I noticed a disturbing trend. The root domains seem to belong to legitimate people and small businesses, completely unrelated to the miracle pill scam going on on their subdomains. So, what is going on here?</p>
<p>I did a whois lookup to find out some more information about the owners of these domains, and it seems as though they&#8217;re all registered with <a href="https://godaddy.com">GoDaddy</a> &#8211; a popular registrar which also offers web hosting and various other services.</p>
<figure id="attachment_82" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-82" src="https://cdn.spammy.blog/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-22-at-12.23.17-AM-300x30.png" alt="Godaddy Whois" width="610" height="61" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-22-at-12.23.17-AM-300x30.png 300w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-22-at-12.23.17-AM.png 686w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">GoDaddy Whois</figcaption></figure>
<p>This on its own isn&#8217;t suspicious, however, whois lookups also reveal the email address of the person who purchased the domain. I decided to take the email addresses of these people and look them up on <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">haveibeenpwned.com</a> &#8211; a website where you can go and find out if you have been victim to any data breaches of various websites &#8211; and to my surprise, every single email address that I checked was indeed a part of one or more data breaches.</p>
<figure id="attachment_85" style="width: 703px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-85" src="https://cdn.spammy.blog/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-22-at-12.27.10-AM-300x41.png" alt="Account Found In Data Breach" width="703" height="96" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-22-at-12.27.10-AM-300x41.png 300w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-22-at-12.27.10-AM-768x105.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-22-at-12.27.10-AM-1024x140.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 703px) 100vw, 703px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Account Found In Data Breach</figcaption></figure>
<p>First, some background on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_breach">data breaches</a>:</p>
<p>From time to time, websites which have registered users (such as <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/read/dropbox-forces-password-resets-after-user-credentials-exposed">Dropbox</a>, or <a href="https://staff.tumblr.com/post/144263069415/we-recently-learned-that-a-third-party-had">Tumblr</a>, or <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/427-million-myspace-passwords-emails-data-breach">MySpace</a>, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/14/yahoo-discloses-hack-of-1-billion-accounts/">Yahoo</a>) get hacked and have their databases of user data dumped for the public to see. This means that information varying from usernames, passwords, dates of birth, IP addresses, and much more, is made available on the Internet.</p>
<p>So what does that have to do with anything? The issue with data breaches is that people tend to reuse the same password for various online services &#8211; for example, someone might use the same email and password combination to login to their Facebook account and their MySpace account. Then, when MySpace gets hacked and all of those usernames and passwords are leaked to the public, someone can now login to the victim&#8217;s Facebook account using the same username and password that they used on MySpace.</p>
<figure id="attachment_87" style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-87" src="https://cdn.spammy.blog/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-22-at-12.32.27-AM-300x128.png" alt="Top 5 Data Breaches" width="635" height="271" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-22-at-12.32.27-AM-300x128.png 300w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-22-at-12.32.27-AM-768x328.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-22-at-12.32.27-AM.png 898w" sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Top 5 Data Breaches</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is likely precisely what happened to the people who are hosting miracle pill scams on their subdomains. They had signed up with their email address and password for a service like MySpace, and then their credentials got leaked onto the Internet, and spammers took all of those leaked email addresses and passwords and tried to login to GoDaddy with them.</p>
<p>Upon successfully logging into an innocent person&#8217;s GoDaddy account, they modified the DNS records to add their own subdomain with which they ultimately went on to host miracle pill scams on, and then send out huge quantities of spam email linking to subdomains of otherwise completely legitimate and innocent websites.</p>
<p>In this way, the people behind the scams can protect themselves from potentially being identified by using someone else&#8217;s websites to host their scams. This is a very clever approach and something we all need to look out for.</p>
<p>Key takeaways:</p>
<p>Firstly, I encourage everyone to head over to <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com">haveibeenpwned.com</a> and check whether their accounts have been victim to any public data breaches, and if so, change your passwords immediately.</p>
<p>Second, it is good practise to never reuse the same password for two different services, that way even if one of them gets hacked and has your username and password leaked, it cannot be used to hijack any of your other accounts with other potentially more important services. A good tool to help with this is <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password.com</a></p>
<p>In addition to never using the same password twice, it is also important to add <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication">two-factor authentication</a> to as many of your accounts as possible. This ensures that even if somebody does somehow figure out your password, they still can&#8217;t gain access to your account.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you believe you may have been victim to someone else hijacking your domain&#8217;s DNS management account, immediately change your password and verify that your DNS records are exactly as you expect them to be. Remove any records which you do not recognize, and if possible, add two-factor authentication for your account.</p>
<p>Here are some useful links to help secure your GoDaddy account:</p>
<p><a href="https://ca.godaddy.com/help/update-your-account-password-7561">How to reset your password<br />
</a><a href="https://ca.godaddy.com/help/enable-two-step-verification-7502">How to enable two-factor authentication<br />

<p>Until next time,</p>
<p>Stay safe.</p>

Here is a sample of such a web page:</p>
<figure id="attachment_64" style="width: 618px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-64" src="https://cdn.spammy.blog/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-11.35.40-PM-300x161.png" alt="Intelligence Pills Spam" width="618" height="332" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-11.35.40-PM-300x161.png 300w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-11.35.40-PM-768x412.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-11.35.40-PM-1024x550.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Intelligence Pills Spam</figcaption></figure>

<p>The web page features a fake news article boasting about some new breakthrough pill which celebrities such as Stephen Hawking confess to being their &#8220;secret to success&#8221;. The article makes up stories about famous historical figures such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostradamus">Nostradamus</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton">Sir Isaac Newton</a>, and how their notes &#8220;revealed a multitude of diverse ingredients that when combined together enhance brain function&#8221;. They go on to claim that Newton was an alchemist, and tested various potions on himself in an effort to find the philosopher&#8217;s stone. It appears as though the authors of this flavour of spam are trying to appeal to a specific subset of people who are likely to buy into tales of alchemists and wizards.</p>

<p>The article goes on and on about the new miracle product &#8220;BrainPlus IQ&#8221;, showing crafted images of various other news sites reporting on the topic. They also show public figure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmet_Oz">Doctor Oz</a>, and reference the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1219289/">Limitless</a>. They really do their best to convince the reader that the article they have come across is legitimate.</p>

<p>This is to make it even more convincing &#8211; surely if other people are trying it with great results, it must be the real deal.</p></blockquote>
<p>So after all of this effort writing up a convincing article about an imaginary pill, what&#8217;s in it for them?</p>
<p>There is no shortage of links to purchase the miracle pill throughout the article &#8211; it was linked 53 times in total &#8211; but if you still managed to make it to the bottom of the page without running off and clicking one of those 53 links to buy yourself a bottle, at the very end of the article they have a call to action to encourage potential victims to purchase the limited supply of miracle pills left.</p>

<p>So, what happens if you happen to fall victim to this article and click on one of the 54 links to buy yourself a bottle? You are presented with a form to fill which looks like your typical online checkout form:</p>
<figure id="attachment_76" style="width: 614px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-76" src="https://cdn.spammy.blog/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-22-at-12.02.54-AM-300x206.png" alt="Miracle Pill Checkout" width="614" height="421" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-22-at-12.02.54-AM-300x206.png 300w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-22-at-12.02.54-AM-768x527.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-22-at-12.02.54-AM-1024x703.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Miracle Pill Checkout</figcaption></figure>
<p>Upon filling out the form you are presented with several options to choose from:</p>
<figure id="attachment_77" style="width: 608px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-77" src="https://cdn.spammy.blog/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-22-at-12.04.03-AM-300x191.png" alt="Miracle Pill Checkout" width="608" height="387" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-22-at-12.04.03-AM-300x191.png 300w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-22-at-12.04.03-AM-768x489.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-22-at-12.04.03-AM-1024x652.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Miracle Pill Checkout</figcaption></figure>
<p>And after selecting your preferred option, you are at last presented with a form to fill out your billing information and hand over your hard earned money.</p>
<p>The whole process is made to look as legitimate as possible, and a considerable amount of effort has gone in to the look and feel of the whole thing.</p>
<p>This flavour of spam has been seen in various forms with slight tweaks to it, from changing the special abilities which the pill gives you to making the article look and feel like it is hosted on various other reputable news sources.</p>
<p>Here are the key take-aways from this flavour of spam:</p>
<ol>
<li>As always, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
<li>Always check the URL of the web page you are on. Even if the article looks like it is on the Forbes website, there&#8217;s a chance you aren&#8217;t actually on the Forbes website.</li>
<li>If your friends send you links like these with enthusiasm, be a good friend and burst their bubble. It&#8217;s fake, and they need to know.</li>
</ol>
<p>Until next time,</p>
<p>Stay safe.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">I have my own mail server which just acts as a forwarder, forwarding every email it receives to one of my personal gmail addresses. I&#8217;ve configured it to accept email from any addresses sent to my domains, and after some time, I started getting spam sent to laurence@spammy.blog and customerservice@spammy.blog. Since I have never used these emails to sign up for anything, I&#8217;m pretty certain that the people behind the spam just try to send emails to any domains which accept email for those prefixes.</p>
<p>Over the past few months I have received lots and lots of spam targeted at those two email prefixes in particular, and they all try to get the receiver of the email to download and run a virus through various means. Here are some examples:</p>
<figure id="attachment_28" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-28" src="https://cdn.spammy.blog/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-7.50.52-PM-300x185.png" alt="Spam Examples" width="660" height="407" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-7.50.52-PM-300x185.png 300w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-7.50.52-PM-768x474.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-7.50.52-PM-1024x632.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Spam Examples</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_29" style="width: 684px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-29" src="https://cdn.spammy.blog/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-7.52.09-PM-300x163.png" alt="Spam Examples" width="684" height="372" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-7.52.09-PM-300x163.png 300w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-7.52.09-PM-768x416.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-7.52.09-PM-1024x555.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Spam Examples</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_47" style="width: 696px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-47 " src="https://cdn.spammy.blog/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-10.52.09-PM-300x132.png" alt="Spam Examples" width="696" height="306" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-10.52.09-PM-300x132.png 300w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-10.52.09-PM-768x337.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-10.52.09-PM-1024x450.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Spam Examples</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the above example, the spammer forged the from address to make it look like it&#8217;s coming from an internal email address. This might appear more convincing to companies using mail clients which don&#8217;t do good spam filtering.</p>
<figure id="attachment_33" style="width: 669px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-33" src="https://cdn.spammy.blog/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-7.57.25-PM-300x148.png" alt="Spam Examples" width="669" height="330" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-7.57.25-PM-300x148.png 300w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-7.57.25-PM-768x379.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-7.57.25-PM-1024x506.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Spam Examples</figcaption></figure>
<p>As we can see from the samples above, the content of the spam always differs but the goal is always the same: to get you to download and install a virus.</p>
<p>Thankfully, gmail does a great job of scanning email attachments for viruses and flags all of them as infected and disables downloading of the attachment. However, if you ever want to download the infected attachment anyway, you can select the option to &#8220;Show original&#8221;, and then press &#8220;Download original&#8221;. You will get a text file which contains a zip file in the form of a base64 encoded string. Turn the base64 string into a binary and unzip it.</p>
<figure id="attachment_34" style="width: 664px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-34" src="https://cdn.spammy.blog/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-8.04.03-PM-300x155.png" alt="Download infected attachment" width="664" height="343" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-8.04.03-PM-300x155.png 300w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-8.04.03-PM-768x398.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-8.04.03-PM-1024x530.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Download infected attachment</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_36" style="width: 699px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-36" src="https://cdn.spammy.blog/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-8.22.19-PM-300x118.png" alt="Download original" width="699" height="275" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-8.22.19-PM-300x118.png 300w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-8.22.19-PM-768x302.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-8.22.19-PM-1024x403.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Download infected attachment</figcaption></figure>
<p>Upon downloading one of the attachments, we find a javascript file which would open in a web browser such as Google Chrome upon attempting to execute it.</p>
<figure id="attachment_35" style="width: 623px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-35" src="https://cdn.spammy.blog/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-8.06.04-PM-300x199.png" alt="Infected Javascript" width="623" height="413" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-8.06.04-PM-300x199.png 300w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-8.06.04-PM-768x509.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-8.06.04-PM-1024x679.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Infected Javascript</figcaption></figure>
<p>Taking a look at the javascript code, it seems to have been obfuscated to prevent easy reverse engineering. The obfuscation renamed variables and functions to be derived from variables called &#8220;DeadAstronautInSpace&#8221; followed by some randomly generated characters.</p>
<p>However, upon quick inspection there appears to be several domains which the script attempts to contact:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">&#34;jinxlaze.com&#47;emch2nr6&#34;, &#34;noveda.nl&#47;viknlp3&#34;, &#34;printo.nl&#47;uxzw0mspm&#34;, &#34;vedicmotet.com&#47;4krn5d7&#34;, &#34;ptworkdomain.com&#47;vicsc4zgya&#34;</pre>
<p>It also looks like it creates ActiveXObjects with parameters such as &#8220;WScript.Shell&#8221;, and &#8220;Scripting.FileSystemObject&#8221;, which would appear to be attempting to execute some sort of ActiveX scripts.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t dig any deeper due to the obfuscation, however chances are the virus would end up sending more spam from the infected computer upon execution. That, or the infected computer becomes one more node in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet">botnet</a>.</p>
<p>Some takeaways from this flavour of spam:</p>
<ol>
<li>laurence@ and customerservice@ are two of the email prefixes which this type of spam targets</li>
<li>The spammer&#8217;s hopes are that most companies have these two emails (perhaps Laurence is a common name?), and that whoever is in charge of those email addresses are likely to be in charge of things such as billing, accounting, receipts, invoicing, and other similar subjects</li>
<li>the end goal of the spam is to get the victim to download and execute a virus which is in the form of an obfuscated javascript file</li>
</ol>
<p>Luckily, as usual, if you use gmail to manage your company email this spam will not even make it to your inbox, and in addition to that it is very difficult to download the virus even going looking through your spam folder.</p>
<p>Until next time,</p>
<p>Stay safe.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we have another flavour of spam which attempts to trick the owner of a domain into paying money for so called &#8220;search engine registration&#8221;, and failure to do so quickly &#8220;may result in [&#8230;] making it difficult for your customers to locate you on the web&#8221;.</p>
<p>Now, there are ways to optimize your website so that it appears higher up in search results, but the wording of the email implies that if you do not pay them, your website will not appear in search results at all. This is of course misleading and untrue.</p>
<p>But what would happen if someone were to follow through and attempt to purchase their &#8220;search engine registration&#8221;? Let&#8217;s find out.</p>
<p>Following the URL in the email takes you to a website which looks something like this:</p>
<figure id="attachment_16" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-16" src="https://cdn.spammy.blog/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-6.51.09-PM-300x161.png" alt="Spammer's Website" width="700" height="375" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-6.51.09-PM-300x161.png 300w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-6.51.09-PM-768x412.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-6.51.09-PM-1024x549.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Spammer&#8217;s Website</figcaption></figure>
<p>Filling out the form, we can see the prices which they charge for their so called service:</p>
<figure id="attachment_18" style="width: 746px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-18" src="https://cdn.spammy.blog/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-6.54.18-PM-300x113.png" alt="Spammer's Website Registration Form" width="746" height="281" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-6.54.18-PM-300x113.png 300w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-6.54.18-PM-768x288.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-6.54.18-PM-1024x384.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Spammer&#8217;s Website Registration Form</figcaption></figure>
<p>The prices range from $47 to $297 for various numbers and timeframes of &#8220;search engine registration&#8221;. So let&#8217;s try to purchase the top package for our domain, google.com. Upon pressing the &#8220;submit now!&#8221; button, we see this:</p>
<figure id="attachment_20" style="width: 729px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-20" src="https://cdn.spammy.blog/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-6.56.31-PM-300x151.png" alt="Spammer's Website Checkout" width="729" height="367" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-6.56.31-PM-300x151.png 300w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-6.56.31-PM-768x387.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-6.56.31-PM-1024x516.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 729px) 100vw, 729px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Spammer&#8217;s Website Checkout</figcaption></figure>
<p>At this point they reassure you that they provide world-class search engine registration and that you will receive some order confirmation upon payment via PayPal. Seems pretty promising. Now, let&#8217;s take a look at the PayPal URL to see if we can pull any information about the spammer.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">https:&#47;&#47;www.paypal.com&#47;cgi-bin&#47;webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=&lt;spammer&#39;s_email&gt;&amp;item_name=TOP%2050%20Engines%20-%205%20Years+-+google.com++solocomputers-co-za&amp;amount=297&amp;currency_code=USD</pre>
<p>From the URL we can see the spammer&#8217;s PayPal email address (removed in this blog post) which all the scammed money goes to. I have gone ahead and reported the website along with the email address to PayPal, and if you come across any websites or email addresses which you would like to report to PayPal, you can go ahead and forward the information to their <a href="https://www.paypal.com/ca/selfhelp/contact/email">customer support team</a>.</p>
<p>There are some things to take away from these sorts of emails:</p>
<p>Firstly, there is a legitimate process in which you can submit web pages to search engines such as Google.com for the web pages to be re-crawled in real time, and this ensures that the search engine has the most up-to date information about your web pages. You can read about Google&#8217;s process <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6065812?hl=en">here</a>.</p>
<p>However, this is a free process which search engines provide for webmasters to take advantage of. Also, search engines will periodically re-crawl everything they find on the Internet without you asking them to.</p>
<p>So, although the spam we received in this case is clearly a scam and will not benefit your website in any way, upon interrogation the person behind the spam will likely claim that they are simply charging for the free service of submitting web pages to be re-crawled and that they are doing nothing wrong.</p>
<h5>Digging a little deeper</h5>
<p>Taking a look at the website source code reveals nothing particularly interesting except that they use Google analytics to track page hits.</p>

<p>Doing a whois lookup on the domain reveals that the domain is registered to somebody by the name of Andy from Yellowwood Park, South Africa. This seems to match up with the domain which is registered under the top level domain of co.za which is indeed under South Africa.</p>

<p>This is not the first time we have seen this flavour of spam, in fact this same scheme with search engine registration is fairly popular and there seem to be several different players involved judging from the layouts of the websites which they use.</p>
<p>Until next time,</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For our first flavour of spam, here is one which has been around since the dark ages.</p>
<p>On December 20th, 2016, there was a wave of spam emails sent out promising the &#8220;opportunity to quintuple your money before Christmas&#8221;. Of course I was very interested by such a subject line, just thinking that I just might be able to finally afford that brand new McLaren 650s which I&#8217;ve wanted for so long.</p>
<p>The contents of the email go on about a mobile games developer which they claim &#8220;has built some of the most popular games on the planet&#8221;. Games which have &#8220;been downloaded more than 100 million times&#8221;, and how the company plans on launching even more games come the new year. All of this is well and good, I&#8217;m happy for this games developer &#8211; but what does this have to do with me?</p>
<p>Then the email starts to get to the point, talking about how the company stock is extremely undervalued right now (trading for mere pennies) and there are rumours circulating that King (the makers of Candy Crush Saga) is going to purchase this successful mobile games developer for the incredible price of $1.17 per share! What a great opportunity to make a quick buck.</p>
<p>The email ends with the line &#8220;This is your chance to buy a stock just days before a major acquisition and stand to gain more than 1,500% just days before Christmas.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, let&#8217;s recap:</p>
<ol>
<li>There&#8217;s a great mobile games developer who has a track record of success and is about to launch several more games in the new year</li>
<li>This mobile games developer is currently extremely undervalued on the stock market (shares are going for mere pennies)</li>
<li>Major player in the mobile games market King is rumoured to be purchasing the company for $1.17 per share, providing a brilliant opportunity to make a quick buck before Christmas</li>
</ol>
<p>Sounds too good to be true? It usually is.</p>
<p>Surely nobody would jump at the occasion and spend all their money on penny stocks just because they got an email from a random stranger telling them to, right? Wrong.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s do a little digging into the stock of SWRM. Here is what their trade volume looks like over the past 6 months:</p>
<figure id="attachment_8" style="width: 680px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-8" src="https://cdn.spammy.blog/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-2.34.48-PM-300x56.png" alt="SWRM Trade Volume" width="680" height="127" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-2.34.48-PM-300x56.png 300w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-2.34.48-PM-768x142.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-2.34.48-PM-1024x189.png 1024w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-2.34.48-PM.png 1362w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">SWRM Trade Volume (6 months)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Virtually no trading has gone on for this stock throughout the duration of its existence, except of course for those few huge spikes at the end. Let&#8217;s blow that up for just the past 5 days:</p>
<figure id="attachment_11" style="width: 677px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-11" src="https://cdn.spammy.blog/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-2.37.30-PM-300x62.png" alt="SWRM Trade History" width="677" height="140" srcset="https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-2.37.30-PM-300x62.png 300w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-2.37.30-PM-768x160.png 768w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-2.37.30-PM-1024x213.png 1024w, https://spam-blog.razb.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-21-at-2.37.30-PM.png 1364w" sizes="(max-width: 677px) 100vw, 677px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">SWRM Trade Volume (5 days)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As we can see, there are several hundred thousand shares purchased on December 18th &#8211; Two days before the spam was sent out, and then the day of the spam wave (December 20th), there is somewhere around 30 million shares traded. This is pretty conclusive evidence that people are falling victim to the spam email scam and actually going out and purchasing the penny stocks.</p>
<p>This sort of activity is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump_and_dump">Pump and Dump</a>; when someone encourages others to purchase shares of an otherwise worthless stock only so that he can dump the shares he owned previously for a higher price, at the expense of those which he tricked into purchasing.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time this sort of stock market spam was sent out and exploited for profit, Grant Jordan <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDamqTjPwg">spoke at DefCon 17</a> about this same trend which he tracked several years ago. It seems as though spammers are trying again.</p>
<p>Until next time,</p>
<p>Stay safe.</p>
