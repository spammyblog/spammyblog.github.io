<p>Earlier this year we covered a <a href="https://spammy.blog/penny-stocks/">flavour of spam which tried to convince the reader to buy out penny stocks</a> promising huge gains within the coming weeks. Starting with the beginning of April, there was another huge wave of spam sent out in an attempt to get people to buy into a different stock.</p>
<p>As with the previous penny stocks emails, the people behind the spam buy massive amounts of shares of a poorly known company for dirt cheap. Then, when they&#8217;ve acquired a whole bunch of shares, they send out the spam in an attempt to get people to buy their shares at an artificially inflated price.</p>
<p>Included below are all of the various spam email templates which were sent out:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Subject: I have a tip I want to share with you</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In less than 2 days, this stock will go up 20 times overnight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve done a lot for you over the years and you&#8217;ve made an insane amount of profits listening to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today and tomorrow is your last chance to seize the opportunity before it disappears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My good friend who works at a firm I will not mention in upstate NY told me that a big takeover is about to happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A little American biopharma company discovered a new treatment for cancerous tumors and one of the biggest companies (starts with a P) is going to announce the official takeover on Wednesday (in 2 days).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The price at which this will happen more than 20 times what their stock is trading at now. Literally at 23 bucks a share from a current 80 cents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Write this symbol down, it&#8217;s the first letter of each word: Quest Science Management Gate that&#8217;s q followed by s then m and g</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the 4 letter symbol you need to tell your broker you want to buy, or just type it in yourself in your brokerage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope you&#8217;re ready to make it big. I expect a big thank you and an invite for steak this weekend.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Subject: By tomorrow evening this stock will be twenty times higher</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you read my urgent email yesterday?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I outlined very specifically a game plan for you to make more than 20 times on your principle within the next 48 hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me hit you with the gravy and leave out all the boring details… there&#8217;s a friend of mine who works at a top 50 firm upstate and he was privy to details of a take over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a nutshell there is a very large pharmaceutical company (its name starts with a P) who is finalizing the acquisition of a small public corporation that is currently trading at around 80 cents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The take over price will be a little over 20 bucks and the official announcement is coming tomorrow night (wed night).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They&#8217;re paying this much for it because of a novel stem cell treatment which eradicates cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t need to tell you what will happen to the share price when this announcement hits the news outlets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s trading symbol is Q as in Quest, S as in Sam, M as in Mother, G as in Great.</p>
<p>These are the 4 letters you need to type into your brokerage account to buy the stock or give to your broker over the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just ten thousand bucks into this will turn into over two hundred grand by Thursday morning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to act quickly though because it seems I may not be the only one with this information, as I am seeing the price creep up a little already since Monday.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Subject: This company&#8217;s being acquired tomorrow</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its share price is going through the stratosphere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cat might be out of the bag now but there is still a massive opportunity to benefit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I say that the secret is out because the stock price has gone up two days in a row but the reality is that it must be very few people who know information otherwise it would&#8217;ve gone ten times higher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case you missed my message yesterday, here is what is happening.. A big pharma corp is acquiring a minuscule public co and this is happening at a price that is 20 times greater than where it currently is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that if you can put 10 thousand in right now, you will take out 200 grand by Thursday morning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This info is solid. It comes from an attorney who&#8217;s a long time friend of mine and who literally saw the acquisition documents with his own eyes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must be wondering what the company&#8217;s trading symbol is, and I will not tease you any longer… it&#8217;s Q like in Quality, S like in Straight, M like Mary and G like Gold</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These four letters together make up the company&#8217;s ticker and that&#8217;s what you will need to give to your broker, or type into your online account to purchase the stock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I highly recommend you do this as quickly as possible because there is no guarantee that the price will remain this low much longer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I expect it&#8217;ll continue to rise and rise as the insider information spreads. Nonetheless the potential to benefit is absolutely gigantic here.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Subject: This time sensitive information could make you very wealthy</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you missed my heads up over this last week and a half, this is finally your time to act because in just 48 hours something big is going to happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is probably the last time that I will contact you  with this information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My friend at goldman gave me a call over the weekend and told me that the big acquisition we’ve been waiting for is going to occur on Wednesday. The day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pfizer is going to complete the purchase of QSMG (a small, public company) at a price of 23.79 dollars a share. For those of you doing the math out there, that&#8217;s approximately 30 times higher than where the stock is at now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re wondering why it&#8217;s happening at such a high price, that’s because these guys just completed human trials on a cancer drug which has proved to be effective in around 40% of cases, and big pharma wants this for itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect that I am not the only one who might have heard of this news so the stock may start climbing today and tomorrow before the big announcement becomes public on Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is quite literally the chance of a lifetime. If you miss out, you&#8217;ll probably never be able to make 30x on your money so fast again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ten grand into QSMG today will turn into a quarter million bucks by Thursday.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Subject: This stock tip is for your eyes only. The chance may never come again</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know of a cutting edge company that has just completed the development of a new life saving medicine. A friend who works at a high position, at a secretive place told me about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This medicine has been proven in both lab tests, and human tests to destroy tumors in almost 50% of of instances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For all practical purposes, I would call it a cure for one of the most deadly diseases of our times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being the type of person that I am, I asked myself how we can profit from this information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answer is very simple. Within the next week or two, QSMG will make the announcement public and once they do, their stock will go up to over 20 bucks overnight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the trick is to grab shares right now, while their price is still dirt cheap and while nobody knows what&#8217;s about to come.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is how you get your big break. This is how your life will finally change. Take the leap forward.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Subject: Do not miss on this chance to triple your money in the market</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a rare opportunity in the market right now, so rare that it may only happen once in a lifetime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have it on good information that a small biotech company is about to receive approval from the f d a for a life-saving medicine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This medicine is poised to become the next biggest seller in the world as it has just been shown to kill cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why there has been a lot of activity surrounding the stock. People are trading it on wrong information, and it&#8217;s in the red today because of that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I highly suggest that you buy in right now while fools are getting out, and the stock is cheap because it&#8217;s going to go up twenty fold in the next 2 weeks when the public announcement comes out, and the medicine is officially approved. Move quickly though, because otherwise you will miss out.</p>

<p><strong>Subject: Here is a tip that could change your life</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a good friend who works at the fda, and from time to time he tells me about things before they happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why I am sending you this message today. Earlier this week he told me about a company that has found a way to kill cancer tumors in 40% of all breast and prostate cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this isn&#8217;t a one hundred percent method, it works good enough to save over 50 million lives a year.<br />
The company just completed human trials a couple of weeks ago and have yet to release the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once those positive results hit the public, the company&#8217;s shares are going to go nuts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>QSMG is currently at under 3 bucks a share. I can guarantee that it will pass 25 to 30 before the end of the month when those results are out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Act quickly by getting in now and securing yourself a position ahead of the herd.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Subject: An imminent event is sending this stock price through the roof.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What if I told you that I know of a company that has actually found a cure for cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They have proven its efficacy in animal tests and have recently just completed their testing on humans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results of the tests on the human subjects are not out yet, we are expecting them to become public some time in the next two to three weeks, but a friend of mine who works at the FDA told me that they are life changing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that in around forty percent of cases, tumors were successfully destroyed. This number is absolutely huge!<br />
It means that more than a third of the people with cancer can be cured with this therapy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is going to change the world, and once the announcement becomes public,<br />
it is guaranteed that their stock price will go to more than 24 to 30 bucks in a matter of hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why I highly, highly recommend that you buy QSMG as soon as you can today. Get in ahead of the herd.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Subject: This company found a cure for cancer. Their stock is flying.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a super rare opportunity that may never come again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This biotech company has finally found a cure for cancer after more than 20 years of stem cells and immunotherapy research.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They had very positive trials both on animals and humans (according to my sources) where tumors got killed at a rate of 41%</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their medicine is going to change the world once it gets rolled out in a few months. We are awaiting an official announcement form the company in the next couple of weeks, but it seems I am not the only one in the know because their stock has quadrupled since last week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>QSMG is guaranteed to hit 25 bucks a share overnight once they release their announcement to the public. You really need to think about buying shares right now before it shoots up higher.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Subject: An imminent green light from the fda will send this drug maker soaring.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are very few times in life when we truly get the chance to be part of something big, and profitable at the same time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The doctors at QSMG have been working nonstop for more than 20 years to get to this moment a cure for cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They completed animal trials last year which were very positive, and completed human trials just a few days ago with the fda&#8217;s blessing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results are not out yet but according to my sources, the human trials were very successful as well and cancer cells were successfully killed in 40% of all cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>40% might not seem like a passing grade, but it is above and beyond what everyone was expecting. This makes it the most successful cancer drug on earth, and best of all it is non-invasive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results will be announced this month, and once they are out the stock will jump to $25 a share overnight and will continue up to $50 or more quickly after.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Want to feel like a genius? Buy QSMG right now while it&#8217;s still at just 2 dollars, and wait it out 2 weeks. You will be rewarded handsomely.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The general theme of the emails is that there is some company which is rumoured to have found a cure for cancer. Some emails claim the company will be acquired by a large pharmaceutical company, other emails don&#8217;t. All the emails claim that the share price for this company in particular is going to skyrocket to 20-30x within a few days, and they are trying to create a sense of urgency for the reader to buy in ASAP.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection of the stock they&#8217;re boasting, here is the price history as reported by Google:</p>
